Hi and welcome on my website where you can find articles about computer science.

This article is supposed to describe me.
At the end of this article you can see my `Résumé`_.

----------
Who I am ?
----------

My name is Loïc Penaud, I'm 21 years old and I live in Brittany, France.

--------------------------------
How I started computer science ?
--------------------------------

I started computer science at high school, I was fiddling some scripts on Python_ and JavaScript_ on my free time.

What was useful to me during my end project of baccalaureate Sciences and Technology of the industry in sustainable development,
where I programmed a server with some JavaScript helped by node.js_.
Then for the first time, I put my passion at the service of my studies.

And Since then I continue my work in computer science, in fact I'm in first year of Master at `UBO college`_.

----------------------------------
What is the goal of this website ?
----------------------------------

This website allows me to write articles to share my knowledge and learn even more.

For the moment, I don't want to impose to me a rhythm of publication, because I write when I have some free time.
